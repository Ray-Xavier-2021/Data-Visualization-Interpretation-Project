## Conclusion

In this project, my primary objective was to gain hands-on experience in interpreting and extracting insights from Tableau dashboards. I had the opportunity to explore various dashboards, selecting one of personal interest. From this chosen dashboard, I uncovered three significant insights, each substantiated by relevant static images. One crucial finding was the substantial foreign population in the "Carabanchel" district, accounting for 16.2% of its residents. This project not only enhanced my data interpretation skills but also emphasized the importance of conveying data-driven insights effectively.
